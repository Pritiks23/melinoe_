      <h2>Red-Teaming</h2>
      <p>
        Red-teaming involves systematically testing AI models against adversarial inputs to identify vulnerabilities, failure modes, and unsafe behaviors. 
        It can include prompt injection, scenario stress-testing, and edge-case simulations. Architecturally, this may involve sandboxed evaluation environments, logging modules, and automated attack scripts.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Techniques:</strong> Fuzzing, adversarial prompt generation, simulated multi-step attacks. 
        <strong>Strengths:</strong> Detects blind spots, improves model robustness, and informs safety guardrails. 
        <strong>Limitations:</strong> Cannot cover all potential adversarial scenarios, requires domain expertise to design effective tests, and may miss emergent behaviors in production.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Use cases:</strong> Identifying unsafe completions in chatbots, testing reasoning agents, and validating high-stakes AI systems (finance, healthcare, autonomous systems).
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Bias Mitigation</h2>
      <p>
        Bias mitigation addresses unfair or harmful model outputs by adjusting training data, model architecture, or post-processing logic. 
        Approaches include re-weighting datasets, adversarial debiasing, constrained decoding, and embedding space regularization. 
        Monitoring metrics like demographic parity, equal opportunity, and representation fairness is critical for evaluation.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Techniques:</strong> Pre-processing (data curation), in-processing (loss function constraints), post-processing (output adjustments). 
        <strong>Strengths:</strong> Reduces systemic harms, improves trustworthiness, supports regulatory compliance. 
        <strong>Limitations:</strong> May reduce model performance, cannot eliminate all biases, and requires continuous monitoring as data evolves.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Use cases:</strong> Language models generating inclusive content, recommendation systems avoiding stereotype propagation, and fairness-aware decision-making systems.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Alignment</h2>
      <p>
        Alignment ensures AI systems act according to intended objectives and human values. Architecturally, alignment often involves reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF), reward modeling, or rule-based constraints integrated into the inference pipeline. 
        Key challenges include value specification, reward hacking, and maintaining alignment during iterative updates.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Techniques:</strong> RLHF, rule-constrained inference, constitutional AI, scalable oversight. 
        <strong>Strengths:</strong> Promotes safe autonomous behaviors, reduces unintended actions, and enhances trust in AI deployment. 
        <strong>Limitations:</strong> Alignment is not guaranteed for out-of-distribution tasks, requires significant human supervision, and may conflict with task efficiency.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Use cases:</strong> Chatbots following ethical guidelines, autonomous agents respecting safety protocols, and mission-critical AI systems in regulated industries.
