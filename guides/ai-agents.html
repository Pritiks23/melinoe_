      <h2>LangChain Agents</h2>
      <p>
        LangChain agents are modular, LLM-driven systems designed for complex workflows requiring memory, reasoning, and tool orchestration. 
        Architecturally, they combine <strong>chains</strong> (for sequential reasoning steps), <strong>agents</strong> (decision-making modules), and <strong>toolkits</strong> (APIs, databases, or custom code). 
        They maintain context across interactions using structured memory objects such as <em>vector stores</em> or <em>conversation buffers</em>.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Prompting strategy:</strong> Uses dynamic prompt templates that adapt based on tool output, user input, and previous reasoning steps. 
        <strong>Strengths:</strong> High modularity, extensibility, easy integration with external data sources. 
        <strong>Limitations:</strong> Sensitive to prompt design and requires careful memory management to prevent context drift in long-running tasks.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Use cases:</strong> Automated knowledge retrieval, report generation, multi-API orchestration, and interactive assistants with context-aware reasoning.
      </p>

    <section>
      <h2>AutoGPT</h2>
      <p>
        AutoGPT is a fully autonomous, goal-driven agent capable of self-prompting, iterative reasoning, and task decomposition. 
        The architecture relies on a looped feedback mechanism where the agent:
        <ol>
          <li>Generates a task list from a high-level goal.</li>
          <li>Executes subtasks using connected tools or APIs.</li>
          <li>Evaluates outcomes, updates context, and plans next steps.</li>
        </ol>
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Prompting strategy:</strong> Multi-layered self-prompting with recursive refinement, allowing the agent to adjust instructions based on partial results. 
        <strong>Strengths:</strong> Handles open-ended goals, autonomous reasoning, minimal human supervision. 
        <strong>Limitations:</strong> Can propagate errors across iterations if feedback evaluation is weak; requires careful control of resource usage and API limits.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Use cases:</strong> Continuous content generation, autonomous process automation, AI-driven research pipelines, and exploratory problem-solving in dynamic environments.
      </p>

      <h2>CrewAI</h2>
      <p>
        CrewAI is a multi-agent orchestration framework enabling concurrent, role-based collaboration among autonomous agents. 
        Each agent is specialized (e.g., data processing, planning, reasoning) and communicates via an internal messaging protocol or shared memory. 
        The framework supports dynamic task allocation, parallel execution, and collective decision-making.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Prompting strategy:</strong> Role-specific prompts that define capabilities and responsibilities, combined with coordination messages to synchronize agents. 
        <strong>Strengths:</strong> High scalability, robust collaboration, optimized for complex multi-agent workflows. 
        <strong>Limitations:</strong> Increased complexity in debugging, potential for deadlocks, and requires orchestration logic to prevent task collisions.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Use cases:</strong> Distributed AI simulations, large-scale automation, multi-step decision-making pipelines, and coordinated research or analysis tasks.
